# Knock_Knock_Jokes

This project was made to practice the concepts of socket programming in Java. 
Here I have tried to simulate the knock knock jokes between a client and a server.
So, the server initiates the conversation with the client by sending "Knock! Knock!", the client responds with a "Who's there" and then 
the conversation carries forward.



Example:

Server: Knock! knock!

Client: Who's there?

Server: Batman

Client: Batman, who?

Server: I am the vengeance. I am the night. I am Batman! Do you want to play more? y/n?

Client: y

Server: Knock! Knock!

.. and so on.
